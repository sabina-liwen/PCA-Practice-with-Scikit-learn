# PCA Practice with Scikit-learn

This repository documents a structured practice of Principal Component Analysis (PCA), adapted and cleaned from an original teaching notebook.  
The workflow has been reorganized to make each step of the PCA pipeline explicit and interpretable.

Key steps include:
- Data standardization  
- Covariance vs. correlation  
- Eigenvalues and explained variance ratio  
- Projection onto principal components  
- Variable loadings and correlation circle  

## Focus of this notebook
- Building clear conceptual links between PCA theory and scikit-learn implementation  
- Step-by-step visualizations (scores, loadings, correlation circle)  
- Clarifying common pitfalls (standardization, interpretation of inertia, cos² vs. loadings)  

## Tech stack
- Python  
- pandas, numpy  
- scikit-learn  
- matplotlib  

## Notes
This notebook is intended for learning, documentation, and reproducibility.
